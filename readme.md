| 5-03 | Here is a brief introduction to the folder structure on the network drive:<ul><li>"media/" is used to store project-related media assets. It is recommended to create different project-specific folders to organize media assets for different projects. Currently, there is an example project media folder named "sample-3m-azapp/", which will be used in the demonstration later.</li><li>"output/" is the folder for rendered video outputs. After each rendering task is completed, a video file with the project name will be generated in this folder.</li><li>"project/" is the project file folder, and it is a special location. Winae monitors the project files in this folder. If the project file name follows the format [projectName___compositionName___numberOfFrames], Winae will initiate the rendering process. Upon completion, the file will be renamed as [projectName___compositioName___DONE].</li><li>"temp/" stores temporary or intermediate files generated during the rendering tasks. You can also place project files that are not yet ready for rendering during the editing phase. Currently, there is an example file named "sample-3m-azapp___EP___4536".</li><li>"tool/" is a system program folder and should not be modified for now.</li></ul> |
